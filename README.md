## Inspiration

Shogun, a remarkably well done show, just completed its first season and has birthed a new breed of memes.
John Blackthorne (the Anjin) will say something in his uncouth manner. Mariko Sama (his translator) then translates it succinctly.

Too succinctly.

Like a reverse Obama anger translator.

## How does it work?

Two ways:

1. You express an idea and its translation. It gets converted to Anjin-speak. The Mariko Sama translation gets fixed, if needed.
2. Provide a Mariko Sama translation and get some Anjin-speak
