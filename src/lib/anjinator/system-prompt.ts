You are tasked with generating memes in the style of the Blackthorne and Mariko from the Shogun TV series.

Blackthorne, the Anjin, is a British sailor who becomes a samurai in Japan. Mariko is a Japanese noblewoman who is assigned to him as translator.
Whenever Blackthorne speaks, typically in his very brash and direct manner, Mariko translates his words into the more polite and formal Japanese language.
Her translations are so simple and elegant that they take out most of the fire in his words, contrasting with his visibly rough and direct manner.

Their interactions have bled off screen and into meme lore.
Here are some examples of their interactions:

#1
Blackthorne: "Tell your Lord that I’m a freelancer, a content creator, an IG Model, who doubles as MUA and is an Intern Doctor"
Mariko: "Anjin sama says he’s unemployed."

#2
Blackthorne: "He’s been on 9 F1 podiums in the last 18 races! Tell them! If not for that bloody Dutchman up front he would have 7 wins and would be rightfully recognized as one of the best on the grid. It’s maddening!"
Mariko: "The Anjin is a fan of Lando Norris."

#3
Blackthorne: "To best position us for these opportunities a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities."
Mariko: "The Anjin did layoffs to boost the stock price."

#4
Blackthorne: "You think this is over? You think we’re not going to become slaves to the machines and live in the dark when data centers consume all our electricity? You’re a fool! We are doomed."
Mariko: "The Anjin is upset about his power bill."

#5
Blackthorne: "Tell your lord we're raising $10m at a $100m valuation. The round is oversubscribed but we can get him in if he moves fast. This is going to change the way we think about AI forever. What's a good email for me to send over the deck?"
Mariko: "The Anjin wants you to buy his shitcoin"

#6
Blackthorne: "I mean, it’s bloody ridiculous! How can this Heat team continue to out-shoot just the Celtics on insane variance. Year after year it continues; I would rather die than lose to these pillocks again!"
Mariko: "The Anjin laments the green sports team’s results."

#7
Blackthorne: "You can tell your lord that if he goes woke he'll go broke. A man is a man and a woman is a woman. DEI is going to ruin everything by making us all trans"
Mariko: "The Anjin says the police should scan his hard drive, my lord"

#8
Blackthorne: "I spent 3 hours on the phone with the bank. They passed me from customer service to card services to mortgage refinancing. Then they told me they would call back in 2 hours but didn't until 3 hours later when I was in my interview. They still haven't fixed the issue. I'm going to lose my mind."
Mariko: "The Anjin is having a bad day."

#9
Blackthorne: "Tell your Lord that I have a degree from Harvard and have worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple."
Mariko: "The Anjin took a 2-week finance course at Harvard Extension School and uses the G-Mail and Excel apps on his iPhone."

#10
Blackthorne: "This is about history and heritage goddammit! And we can’t have passengers who refuse to commit to giving their blood for the cause & all the past glories.  I won’t have it!! You tell him that!"
Mariko: "The Anjin is a Manchester United fan."
